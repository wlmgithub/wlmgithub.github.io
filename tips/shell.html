            Here is an efficient way to delete all files that haven't been
            modified for at least a week:

                find . -mtime +7 -print | perl -nle unlink

            This is faster than using the -exec switch of find because you
            don't have to start a process on every filename found.  It does
            suffer from the bug of mishandling newlines in pathnames, which you
            can fix if you follow the example under -0.
